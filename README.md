"# JSONSet"
class for managing JSON objects Arrays in order to

  * Filter desired 'records' (items) of the Array
  * Select desired 'fields' of the JSON element to show info
  * Print to file the whole Array or a filtered / field selection part

The key Idea is prepare information contained in the JSON-Array returned by some API REST Query to be used with Google Charts.
